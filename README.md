- You can also use `npm run build-normal-wine` or `npm run build-sdk-wine` to compile a version that plays nicer with [wine](https://www.winehq.org) compat layer.

If everything is okay, binaries will be available on `build/r3_auto_map_gen/`.

## Other OS?
You can run this app using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) compat layer.
In order to read current game, **make sure to run it under the same prefix**.

...or run R3 Auto Map Gen **with same RE wine args!**

```shell
# Use this command below to run Resident Evil 3: Nemesis + Classic Rebirth DLL
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw.dll=n,b" wine R3\ Auto\ Map\ Gen.exe

# Steam Deck / Proton? Sure! Use add this command to launch options:
